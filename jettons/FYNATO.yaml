description: Invest in the future of your country: Support the exit from NATO! Why is this important? Every year, countries spend billions to support the military bloc, while these funds could be used to develop infrastructure, education, healthcare and innovation. Leaving NATO will allow us to focus on domestic priorities and improve the quality of life of every citizen.
